## 🧠 Matching Logic

- If care type is **day care**, skip zip code and show a “no match” message.
- For **stationary** or **ambulatory** care:
  - Match the **nearest available** facility that serves the patient's zip.
  - If the nearest facility is **full**, try the next nearest.
  - If no suitable match is found within **3000 zip code distance**, show a “no match” message.
